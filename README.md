# Announcements

This repo is for team announcements only. To file a bug or start a discussion, please find the appropriate repo in [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) and create a new issue. For general issue discussions please go to [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues) and create a new issue.

All items posted to this repo are locked, but will typically have links to separate discussion threads in the affected repo. Please use those discussion threads for questions and comments about a particular announcement. If you're not sure where to post a question, please log an issue in the [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues) repo.

To keep the list manageable, we'll usually close issues that are older than one month.
